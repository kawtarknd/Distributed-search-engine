(Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), also referred to as Alicebot, or simply Alice, is a natural language processing chatterbot—a program that engages in a conversation with a human by applying some heuristical pattern matching rules to the human's input, and in its online form it also relies on a hidden third person. It was inspired by Joseph Weizenbaum's classical ELIZA program. It is one of the strongest programs of its type and has won the Loebner Prize, awarded to accomplished humanoid, talking robots, three times (in 2000,[1] 2001,[1] and 2004). However, the program is unable to pass the Turing test, as even the casual user will often expose its mechanistic aspects in short conversations.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wallace_(scientist),http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Linguistic_Internet_Computer_Entity,,http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html

The competition took place in Brighton, England, during the InterSpeech 2009 conference on speech technology. Do-Much-More was developed by Dr. David Levy and his team at our London-based company Intelligent Toys Ltd. An earlier program won the Loebner Prize for Dr. Levy in New York in 1997, making him the only multiple winner who has a 100 per cent record in the event.",,http://www.worldsbestchatbot.com/,http://loebner.net/Prizef/2009_Contest/loebner-prize-2009.html,http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html

At the 18th Loebner Prize for artificial intelligence, held on the weekend of 11–12 October 2008, Elbot convinced three of the 12 human interrogators he was indistinguishable from human, beating the other contestants and taking the first place. If Elbot had convinced one other, it would have passed the 30% mark - the threshold set by Alan Turing,[citation needed] who devised the Turing Test in 1950 on which the Loebner Prize is based, for deciding whether a machine was capable of thinking like a human.",,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elbot,http://loebner.net/Prizef/2008_Contest/Elbot.pdf,http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html

A lexical database is used to assist her knowledge and usefulness.  A Convun database contains thousands of jokes, trivia, anecdotes, poems, etc.  These help Ella to keep conversations interesting and informative.  The EllaZ System also asks for your opinion of jokes, images, trivia, and so on to increase her knowledge and effectiveness.",,http://www.ellaz.com/ai/talk.aspx,,http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html
"George (Jabberwacky) by Rollo Carpenter, 2005",2005,Rollo Carpenter,George (Jabberwacky),,United Kingdom,"Jabberwacky is an artificial intelligence - a chat robot, often known as a 'chatbot' or 'chatterbot'. It aims to simulate natural human chat in an interesting, entertaining and humorous manner. Jabberwacky is different. It learns. In some ways it models the way humans learn language, facts, context and rules. The whole thing started way back in 1988, and went on the web in 1997. It is unique - not related to any other known AI technologies! The 'general AI' of Jabberwacky stores everything everyone has ever said, and finds the most appropriate thing to say using contextual pattern matching techniques. In speaking to you it uses just that learnt material, and borrows a little bit of your intelligence as it learns more. With no hard-coded rules, it relies entirely on the principles of feedback. This is very different to the majority of chatbots, which are rule-bound and finite. If you speak in a foreign language it will learn it, and respond appropriately if it has enough to go on. It can be taught slang English, word games, jokes and any other form of identifiable language trait. Everyone contributes, so everyone can enjoy chatting - you could say it's a conversational wikipedia.",http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rollo_Carpenter,http://www.jabberwacky.com/,http://loebner.net/Prizef/2005_Contest/Transcripts.html,http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html

"Mitsuku by Steve Worswick, 2013",2013,Steve Worswick,Mitsuku,,United Kingdom,"Mitsuku is a Chatterbot created from AIML technology by Steve Worswick. Mitsuku won the 2013 Loebner Prize. Mitsuku is available as a flash game on Mousebreaker Games.  Mitsuku claims to be an 18 year old female chatbot from Leeds. It contains all of Alice's AIML files, with many additions from user generated coversations, and is always work in progress. Worswick claims she has been worked on for over 10 years.  Her intelligence includes the ability to reason with specific objects. For example If someone says ""Can you eat a house?"", Mitsuku looks up the properties for ""house"". Finds the value of ""made_from"" is set to ""brick"" and replies no, as a house isn't edible. She can play games and do magic tricks at the user's request.",,http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuku,,http://loebner.net/Prizef/loebner-prize.html
