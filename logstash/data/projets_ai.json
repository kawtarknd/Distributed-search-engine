(A.K.A.: Poetry Analyzer, Textual Analyzer) is a freeware application that allows users to analyze virtually any sort of text (fiction, newspaper, poetry, history text book). It does this by parsing text, determining sentence structure, identifies mood and tones of sentences. Also identifies primary imagery and themes. Poetry Analyzer's website states that a unique analysis of text is accomplished by studying that which is most overlooked, and considered not relevant.", "tags": ["Specialized Projects", "Knowledge and Reasoning"], "url": "http://pan.sourceforge.net/"}
{"title": "PreAct", "source": "Applied Systems Intelligence", "date": "Unknown", "message": "PreAct is a cognitive engine technology that is driven both by changes in the state of the world and the intent of the system’s users called associate systems. Associate systems are a knowledge-based system that are designed to work in conjunction with a human operator. An associate system observes the same data about the state of the world as the human operator, combining the information together to reach more abstract and aggregate conclusions about the state of the world. An associate system also observes the actions undertaken by a human operator, combining those actions with the state of the world to determine the operator’s current objectives and activities. Based on the assessment of the state of the world and the activities and objectives of the human operator, the system can, within the bounds of its authority, carry out activities on behalf of the user, make the user aware of events particularly relevant to his activities, and manage the information content of the user’s displays. Associate systems stand in contrast to autonomous systems, in which the software replaces the human operator, and decision-aiding systems, in which the software typically assists the human only when requested. An associate system acts as a teammate to a human operator; it can act without explicitly being ordered while remaining within the bounds of its authority, without taking final control away from the human operator.", "tags": ["Specialized Projects", "Cognitive Architechture"], "url": ""}

SEAS \"enables researchers and organizations to try out their models or techniques in a publicly known, realistically detailed environment.\" It \"is now capable of running real-time simulations for up to 62 nations, including Iraq, Afghanistan, and China. The simulations gobble up breaking news, census data, economic indicators, and climactic events in the real world, along with proprietary information such as military intelligence.  The Iraq and Afghanistan computer models are the most highly developed and complex of the 62 available to JFCOM-J9. Each has about five million individual nodes representing things such as hospitals, mosques, pipelines, and people.\" SEAS was developed to help Fortune 500 companies with strategic planning. Then it was used to help \"recruiting commanders to strategize ways to improve recruiting potential soldiers\". In 2004 SEAS was evaluated for its ability to help simulate \"the non-kinetic aspects of combat, things like the diplomatic, economic, political, infrastructure and social issues\". Sentient World Simulation is the name given to the current vision of making SEAS a \"continuously running, continually updated mirror model of the real world that can be used to predict and evaluate future events and courses of action.\"", "tags": ["Specialized Projects", "Other"], "url": "http://www.krannert.purdue.edu/centers/perc/html/aboutperc/seaslabs/seaslabs.htm"}

Its name comes from the fact that it is an artificial neural net trained by a form of temporal-difference learning, specifically TD-lambda. TD-Gammon achieved a level of play just slightly below that of the top human backgammon players of the time. It explored strategies that humans had not pursued and led to advances in the theory of correct backgammon play.", "tags": ["Specialized Projects", "Games"], "url": ""}
